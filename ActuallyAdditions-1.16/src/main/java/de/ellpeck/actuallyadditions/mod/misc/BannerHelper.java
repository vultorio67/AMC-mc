     * (Excerpted from Additional Banners by Darkhax with permission, thanks!)
     * <p>
     * Adds a new banner pattern to the game. This banner pattern will be applied by using the
     * provided item in a crafting recipe with the banner.
     *
     * @param name          The name of the banner pattern. This is used for the texture file, and is
     *                      also converted into upper case and used for the enum entry. Given how this
     *                      system works, it's critical that this value is unique, consider adding the
     *                      mod id to the name.
     *                      //@param id            A small string used to represent the pattern without taking up much space. An
     *                      example of this is "bri". Given how the system works, it is critical that
     *                      this is a unique value. please consider adding the mod id to the pattern id.
     * @param craftingStack An ItemStack which is used in the crafting recipe for this pattern.
     *                      An example of this would be the creeper skull being used for the creeper
     *                      pattern.
